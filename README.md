Part 3: 
GitHub is a web based  control system that saves all the changes in the computer files by tracking it., and is also a internet hosting service. This system is mostly used for coding. GitHub was created on February 8, 2008 in San Francisco, California. The Founders of Github is Tom Preston Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyatt. Some similar platforms to Github is BitBucket, GitLab, and GitKraken. For me, I would use Github for myself when I actually need to save some codes and somehow test them in the future for myself.

Part 7: 
I went to the link, and then I pressed the  README.md, and then I pressed the pencil button.  And then I inputed Lau, Rachel September 11, 2017 9:18pm, clicked the pull option and then submitted.
